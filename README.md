# Cisco Packet Tracer Experiments

This repository contains a series of practical experiments designed to help students and networking enthusiasts understand fundamental concepts of computer networking using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.

## List of Experiments

1. **Simple Network Topology using a Switch**  
   - Demonstrate and configure a simple network topology with a switch.

2. **Router Configuration for Connecting Two Hosts**  
   - Configure a simple router to connect two hosts using different gateways.

3. **DHCP Server Configuration on a Network**  
   - Demonstrate and configure a DHCP server to dynamically assign IP addresses to hosts.

4. **DHCP Server Configuration on a Router**  
   - Configure a router to act as a DHCP server for connected devices.

5. **VLAN Configuration**  
   - Demonstrate and configure a simple VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) to segment network traffic.

6. **Switch Port Security**  
   - Configure switch port security to restrict access to authorized devices only.

7. **LAN Configuration and ARP Operation**  
   - Create a simple LAN and understand the concept and operation of the **Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)**.

8. **Static Routing Configuration Using Two Routers**  
   - Demonstrate and configure static routing to enable communication between different networks.

9. **Routing Information Protocol (RIP) Configuration**  
   - Configure RIP to enable dynamic routing between multiple routers.

10. **OSPF Protocol in Multi-Router Networks**  
    - Demonstrate and configure multiple router networks using the **Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)** protocol.

## Requirements

- [Cisco Packet Tracer](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer) (version 8.x recommended)
- Basic understanding of networking concepts (IP addressing, routing, switching, VLANs)

## Usage

1. Open Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Load the corresponding network topology for the experiment.
3. Follow the configuration steps as per the experiment objective.
4. Test network connectivity using **ping** or other network commands.

## Learning Outcomes

By completing these experiments, learners will be able to:

- Configure switches and routers for small to medium-sized networks.
- Understand and implement IP addressing, DHCP, VLANs, and port security.
- Understand routing protocols such as Static Routing, RIP, and OSPF.
- Troubleshoot basic network connectivity issues.
